## About The Project

This project offers a seamless nomination experience for Twitch users, encouraging engagement and interaction. Upon landing, users are greeted with a prompt to log in to Twitch, ensuring a personalized and secure nomination process.

#### Key Features:
##### 1. Twitch OAuth2 Authentication
Users are required to log in to their Twitch accounts, providing a simple user experience

##### 1. Dynamic Content
The app dynamically fetches categories from a CMS, organized by name and color. Allows us to dynamically update categories without code changes.

##### 1. User-Friendly Nomination
Users can easily select a category of their choice, enter relevant information, and submit their nominations. The streamlined process encourages participation.

##### 1. Responsive Design
Incorporating responsive design principles, the app caters to both mobile and desktop users. This project marks a significant learning milestone for me in adapting layouts for various screen resolutions.

##### 1. Full-Stack Endeavor
Breaking away from the norm, this project is a departure from Python or C# backends. Embracing a single framework for the entire stack showcases versatility and growth. Utilizing Server Side Rendering for secure API Calls.
